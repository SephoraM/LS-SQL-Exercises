/*
  1. DDL - ALTER, DROP, CREATE
     DML - SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE

  2. DML because it is related to the manipulation of data and not the schema

  3. DDL because it is part of the schema and is used to define what kind of
     data should be used and what columns should be in the new table.

  4. DDL. This statement does not manipulate the data, rather it alters the
    table itself.

  5. DML. INSERT is a statement that manipulates data and not how the data is
     structured.

  6. DML. This statement manipulates data and doesn't affect how the data is
     structured.

  7. \d is a meta command, not an sql statement.

  8. DML. This statement manipulates data and does not manipulate the schema

  9. DDL. Although any data within the database would be lost if this statement
     is executed, so we could say that data is being manipulated as well, so
     it's also DML. All other DROP statements are considered DDL.

  10. DDL. CREATE statements are part of Data Definition Language
